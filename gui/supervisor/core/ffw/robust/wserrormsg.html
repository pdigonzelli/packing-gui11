  Description : This program is a replacement for the infamous "White Screen
                of Death" commonly seen in WebSpeed applications.  In cases 
                where a program that is requested cannot be run because of 
                permissions, database outage, compilation errors, or 
                file-not-found errors, this customizable page is displayed in the
                place of the "White Screen of Death"
  Input Param : p_errortext
  Output Param: <none>

  NOTES.......:  Do NOT use any database references in this program.  This error 
                 code must be able to run when databases are not connected!  You
                 could cause some SERIOUS mayhem by using database references here.
			
                 Make sure that you don't use include files that contain database 
                 references.
			
                 Keep this program as simple as possible!!!  Did I mention not
                 to use database references?
				
                 You will probably want to change the stylesheet reference to some
                 thing other than /webspeed/freestyle.css
