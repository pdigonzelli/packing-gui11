# Propath.dat
#
# This file contains entries that will be loaded into the propath 
# by a compile object. Lines beginning with a "#" are comment 
# lines. Each line of this file will be considered another entry 
# in the propath. Multiple propath entries may be entered on one 
# line using a comma "," delimiter. "\" and "/" will be converted 
# to either a slash or backslash depending on the OS to handle 
# portability issues. Blank lines are allowed. The default working 
# directory "." will automatically be added  to the beginning of 
# the propath below. The initial value of the propath will be 
# appended to the end of the propath listed below. 

# Define any variables that will be substituted in the propath
# specified below.
